# Custom hooks: separation of concerns

This repository is an example used in my [blog post](https://dev.to/gabrielprrd/custom-react-hooks-go-beyond-reusability-2hgh) about how React custom hooks can simplify component logic and separate data display from implementation details.

Technologies:

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Jest
- react-testing-library

## Development

First, open your terminal and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

And then:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Testing

To run tests:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
```

Thank you for your time
